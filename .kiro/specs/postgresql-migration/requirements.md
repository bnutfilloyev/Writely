# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves migrating the IELTS Telegram Bot from SQLite to PostgreSQL database to resolve persistent database connection issues and improve production reliability. The migration should maintain all existing data and functionality while providing better performance, concurrent access, and production-grade database features.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to migrate from SQLite to PostgreSQL, so that the bot has better reliability and can handle concurrent users without database locking issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts up THEN it SHALL connect to PostgreSQL instead of SQLite
2. WHEN multiple users interact with the bot simultaneously THEN the database SHALL handle concurrent connections without errors
3. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all existing user data SHALL be preserved
4. WHEN the bot processes requests THEN it SHALL use PostgreSQL for all database operations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the database configuration to be easily manageable through environment variables, so that I can deploy to different environments without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the application THEN the database connection SHALL be configured via environment variables
2. WHEN switching between development and production THEN only environment variables SHALL need to be changed
3. WHEN the database credentials change THEN only the .env file SHALL need to be updated
4. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL validate database connection before proceeding

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want PostgreSQL to be automatically set up in Docker, so that deployment is seamless and doesn't require manual database setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running docker-compose up THEN PostgreSQL SHALL be automatically started as a service
2. WHEN the PostgreSQL container starts THEN it SHALL create the required database and user automatically
3. WHEN the application container starts THEN it SHALL wait for PostgreSQL to be ready before connecting
4. WHEN containers are restarted THEN PostgreSQL data SHALL persist using Docker volumes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want existing SQLite data to be migrated to PostgreSQL, so that no user data or submission history is lost during the transition.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration script runs THEN it SHALL export all data from the existing SQLite database
2. WHEN importing to PostgreSQL THEN all user accounts SHALL be preserved with correct IDs
3. WHEN importing to PostgreSQL THEN all submission history SHALL be preserved with relationships intact
4. WHEN the migration completes THEN the data integrity SHALL be verified through automated checks

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the database to have proper backup and recovery capabilities, so that data is protected against loss.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN PostgreSQL is deployed THEN it SHALL be configured with appropriate backup settings
2. WHEN the system runs THEN database backups SHALL be created automatically
3. WHEN a backup is needed THEN it SHALL include all application data and schema
4. WHEN restoring from backup THEN the system SHALL return to full functionality

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the database schema to be properly managed with migrations, so that future schema changes can be applied safely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL check and apply any pending database migrations
2. WHEN schema changes are needed THEN they SHALL be implemented as versioned migration scripts
3. WHEN migrations run THEN they SHALL be idempotent and safe to run multiple times
4. WHEN a migration fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and rollback options
