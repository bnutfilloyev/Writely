# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves building a Telegram bot that evaluates IELTS writing passages for both Task 1 and Task 2. The bot will use AI-powered assessment to provide band scores and detailed feedback based on official IELTS scoring criteria. It includes user tracking, submission history, and anti-spam protection to create a comprehensive IELTS writing practice tool.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an IELTS candidate, I want to interact with the bot through simple commands, so that I can easily access writing evaluation features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends /start THEN the bot SHALL respond with a greeting message and display three options: "üìÑ Submit Writing Task 1", "üìù Submit Writing Task 2", and "üìä Check Band Score History"
2. WHEN a user selects an option THEN the bot SHALL guide them to the appropriate workflow
3. WHEN a user sends an invalid command THEN the bot SHALL provide helpful guidance on available commands

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an IELTS candidate, I want to submit my writing passages for evaluation, so that I can receive feedback on my writing skills.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a text passage THEN the bot SHALL detect whether it's Task 1 or Task 2 based on content analysis
2. IF the bot cannot determine the task type THEN the bot SHALL ask the user to specify Task 1 or Task 2
3. WHEN a passage is submitted THEN the bot SHALL validate that the text is in English
4. WHEN a passage is too short (less than 50 words) THEN the bot SHALL request a longer submission
5. WHEN a passage is too long (more than 1000 words) THEN the bot SHALL warn the user about typical IELTS word limits

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an IELTS candidate, I want to receive detailed band scores and feedback, so that I can understand my writing performance and areas for improvement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a passage is evaluated THEN the bot SHALL return individual band scores (0.0-9.0) for Task Achievement/Response, Coherence and Cohesion, Lexical Resource, and Grammatical Range and Accuracy
2. WHEN scores are provided THEN the bot SHALL calculate and display an overall average band score
3. WHEN evaluation is complete THEN the bot SHALL provide 3-5 specific improvement suggestions
4. WHEN feedback is generated THEN the bot SHALL justify each band score with specific examples from the text
5. WHEN displaying results THEN the bot SHALL format the response using proper Telegram markdown

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an IELTS candidate, I want to track my submission history and progress, so that I can monitor my improvement over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a passage THEN the system SHALL store the submission, scores, and feedback in a database
2. WHEN a user requests band score history THEN the bot SHALL display their past submissions with dates and scores
3. WHEN displaying history THEN the bot SHALL show progress trends if multiple submissions exist
4. WHEN a user has no history THEN the bot SHALL inform them and encourage their first submission

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a service provider, I want to implement anti-spam protection, so that I can manage API costs and prevent abuse.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user makes submissions THEN the system SHALL track daily submission count per user
2. WHEN a user reaches 3 submissions in a day THEN the bot SHALL inform them of the daily limit
3. WHEN the daily limit is reached THEN the bot SHALL suggest upgrading to Pro for unlimited checks
4. WHEN a new day begins THEN the system SHALL reset the daily submission counter for all users

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the bot to handle errors gracefully, so that users have a smooth experience even when issues occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the OpenAI API is unavailable THEN the bot SHALL inform the user of temporary service issues
2. WHEN the database is unavailable THEN the bot SHALL still provide evaluation but inform about history tracking issues
3. WHEN an evaluation takes longer than 30 seconds THEN the bot SHALL send a "processing" message to keep the user informed
4. WHEN any error occurs THEN the system SHALL log the error for debugging while showing a user-friendly message

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an IELTS candidate, I want accurate and consistent evaluations, so that I can trust the feedback for my exam preparation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN evaluating Task 1 THEN the system SHALL use Task 1 specific criteria focusing on data description and overview
2. WHEN evaluating Task 2 THEN the system SHALL use Task 2 specific criteria focusing on argument development and position
3. WHEN generating scores THEN the system SHALL ensure consistency by using standardized prompts for the AI model
4. WHEN providing feedback THEN the system SHALL avoid hallucinated scores by requiring justification for each band score
5. WHEN assessment is complete THEN the system SHALL ensure all four criteria are evaluated and scored

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to be maintainable and scalable, so that it can handle growth and updates efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the bot receives messages THEN it SHALL use aiogram framework for reliable Telegram integration
2. WHEN storing data THEN the system SHALL use SQLite for lightweight local storage with option to migrate to Firebase
3. WHEN making API calls THEN the system SHALL implement proper rate limiting and error handling for OpenAI API
4. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL be compatible with cloud platforms like Heroku, Render, or Railway
5. WHEN handling concurrent users THEN the system SHALL manage database connections and API calls efficiently
